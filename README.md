**Command:** `wave`

*This command does not require you to use the prefix (%).*

This is the meat and potatoes of hosting waves.  There's a lot going on with this, and will probably change slightly over time, but the release version is enough to get us going. 

The wave command is the only command that can be used by anyone on the server.  However, only wave hosts can use ALL of the functionality. 

`wave` will automatically count your current wave after you've typed `%host` starting at 0.  So you can technically run an entire wave with just using `wave next`.  

**Usages:** `wave next`   `wave 5`   `wave closed`

**Arguments:**
:red_circle: Only works in hosting scenario*

- `anynumber` This is the default functionality that any user can use.  simply say `wave #` and it'll return the embed with the default message.  
- :red_circle: `next` Increments wave number to the next from the current wave.  
- :red_circle: `failed` Sends users your failed message and temporarily posts your trainer code for 30 seconds and then auto deletes it. This will also increment your failed counter.
- :red_circle: `last` Increments the wave number and sends your `%set last` message to users.
- :red_circle: `closed`  Does the following: 
  - Closes out the hosting session.
  - Sends you an overview of your host session.
  - Appends your `%set closed` message to the description.
  - Displays a congratulations message should you beat your personal record.
  - Adds wave information to the wave history database with the following datapoints:
    - userid
    - ign (incase you ran on an alt)
    - starttime
    - endtime
